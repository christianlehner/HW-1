## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Delaney, Joy, Kyler
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 12 hours 
* What gave you the most trouble: the first question
* Any comments you have: still figuring out ggplot




## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flightsdelays <- filter(flights, dep_delay > 30) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  rename(delays = n)
flightstotal <- flights %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(flightnum = n)
flightsprop <- flightsdelays %>% 
            mutate(propflightsdelay = delays/flightstotal$flightnum) %>% 
            mutate(propflightsdelay = round(propflightsdelay, digit = 3))
plot <- ggplot(data=flightsprop, aes(x=date, y=propflightsdelay)) + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Flights Delayed By More than 30 Minutes Each Day") + geom_point(stat="identity") 
plot 
```
There is larger proportions of delays of more than 30 minutes in the summer in Houston. The lowest proportion occurs in October. I can only speculate the this is caused by either crowding of the runway in summer months or summer thunderstorms. There are also extreme outliers which could possible times where the entire runway is shut down for brief periods of time due to a weather or other threat. 


## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
oldplanes <- left_join(planes, flights, by = "plane") %>% 
             select(carrier, plane, year) %>% 
             distinct(plane)
p <- ggplot(oldplanes, aes(factor(carrier), year)) + labs(x = "Carrier Abbrevition", y = "Year")
p + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Bar Plots of the Age of Planes Each Carrier's Fleet")
```

The boxplots show the median and the quartile ranges of each fleets age. MQ or American Eagle has by far the lowest median but if you look at the size of their fleet in Houston it is not too relevant. The have a tiny fleet compared to the rest. A more significant airline to fly if preferring older planes is American Airlines; their outliers are also all older planes. Preferably don't choose Alaskan Airlines abbreviation AS, as they hold the highest median for age of any fleet.





## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
airports <- airports %>% rename(dest = iata)
swdest <- inner_join(flights, airports, by = "dest") %>% 
  select(state, dest, carrier, flight) %>% 
  filter(carrier == "WN") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(swflights = n)

swdest$state <- factor(swdest$state, levels = swdest$state[order(-swdest$swflights)])
a <- ggplot(data=swdest, aes(x=state, y=swflights)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 
a + ggtitle("All SW Flights by Occurence") + labs(y="Total Flights")

swdest2 <- inner_join(flights, airports, by = "dest") %>%
          filter(carrier == "WN") %>% 
          select(state, dest, carrier, flight) %>% 
          distinct(flight) %>% 
          group_by(state) %>% 
          tally() %>% 
          rename(swflights2 = n)
swdest2$state <- factor(swdest2$state, levels = swdest2$state[order(-swdest2$swflights2)])
p <- ggplot(data=swdest2, aes(x=state, y=swflights2)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 
p + ggtitle("Specific Flight Paths by State") + labs(y = "Flight Paths ")
```
Southwest airlines tended to fly around Texas both by the number of flight paths but the number of flights themselves. Florida followed but barely a third of the number of flights that occur in Texas. Texas definitely holds a massive margin at least 2 thirds above all other states both in flights, and their paths. There are about 600 flight paths to other cities in Texas, and over a 15000 flights over the course of the year in Texas to other airports in the state.



## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
patterns1 <- left_join(flights, weather, by = "date") %>%
            group_by(conditions) %>% 
            tally() %>% 
            rename(total = n) 
patterns2 <-  left_join(flights, weather, by = "date") %>%
              filter(dep_delay > 30) %>%
              group_by(conditions) %>% 
              tally() %>% 
              rename(delays = n)
patterns3 <- left_join(patterns1, patterns2, by =  "conditions") %>%
              mutate(proportion = delays/total)
patterns3$conditions <- factor(patterns3$conditions, levels = patterns3$conditions[order(-patterns3$prop)])
ggplot(data=patterns3, aes(x=conditions, y=proportion)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("Proportion of Flights Delayed > 40' by Conditions") + coord_flip()        
```
The conditions that are most associated with departure significant departures delays are thunderstorms and rain. Some of the variables seem counter intuitive, why does rain have a higher proportion of delays than freezing rain? The same occurs with light thunderstorms over heavy thunderstorms.  What does make sense is that "cloudy" or "overcast" have smaller proportions than serious weather patterns. I decided to not do an average of the delays because I thought the setting delays at a minimum of 40 minutes was significant enough as that is when people will start missing connections. The next step I think would be to compare this analysis to taking the average of the total delays for each weather pattern.




## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
julydest <- left_join(flights, airports, by = "dest") %>% 
  mutate(month = months(date)) %>%
  filter(month == "July") 
july <- left_join(julydest, states, by = "state") 
mytable <- table(july$carrier, july$region)
x <- prop.table(mytable, 1) #I coudln't find easier way to calculate proportions across two categorical variables
df <- tbl_dt(x) 
p<- ggplot(df,aes(V1,N,fill=V2))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = position_dodge(width=.8)) + labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Carrier", legend = "region") +
  ggtitle("Carriers' Proportion of Flights to Each Region") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Region")) 
p 
```
Some Carriers only flew to certain regions while others flew to all but it is obvious that the highest proportion for most of the carriers was held by the south. This is due to Houston being located in the south. New England had a minor proportion of of most of the carriers flight destination besides for AS. The two bars that are on both sides of the white variable line that extendeds above the carrier abbreviations are the proportions linked to the variable.
